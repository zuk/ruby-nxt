<b>The ruby-nxt library lets you control the LEGO
Mindstorms NXT robotics kit via Bluetooth using the Ruby language.</b>

There are two interfaces:

- <b>High-Level</b>: The NXT class provides multi-threaded, object-oriented interface to the
  motors, sensors, and most other core NXT functions.
  
- <b>Low-Level</b>: The NXTComm class provides direct access to the NXT Bluetooth
  bytecode protocol. There is also the UltrasonicComm class which implements
  the I2C communications needed to interact with the ultrasonic sensor (via NXTComm).
  
ruby-nxt requires the <tt>ruby-serialport</tt> library which you must manually download and install from:
http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-serialport


=== Tests & Examples

Most of the ruby-nxt library is well documented with example code. In particular, see
NXT if you prefer high-level programming or NXTComm if you need access to low-level
direct commands.

Additionally, the <tt>examples</tt> directory in the ruby-nxt distribution contains examples of some
of the library's functionality. <tt>nxt_remote_control.rb</tt> in particular provides
a basic graphical (Tk) interface for controlling and monitoring the NXT.

The <tt>tests</tt> directory contains automated unit tests for testing the core NXT protocol
(<tt>nxt_comm_test.rb</tt>) and and the motors (<tt>nxt_comm_test.rb</tt>), as well as an interactive
test suite (<tt>test_sensor.rb</tt>) for testing the functionality of all of the sensors.
It is recommended that you run all of these tests before attempting to use the
ruby-nxt library in order to ensure that your NXT is behaving as expected.

To run the tests, be sure that all three motors and sensors are plugged in to the
standard ports. The motors should not have any LEGO pieces attached.
